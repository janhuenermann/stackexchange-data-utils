```
So I am trying to add a comment for a project that I am working on with other people on Bitbucket, is it possible to just push a comment to the site? Since I am not trying to make changes to the file, but I do have comments to make. <TAGS> git <SUMMARY> can you push just a comment on git? (like you don't want to make specific changes, but you want to add a comment) <ANSWER> This takes away from what Git is designed to do, so even if there is a way of doing it it wouldn't be a good idea. Using BitBucket's issue tracker or wiki systen would be a much better idea.
